-	Top 10 profitable products: Barbie Dolls, LEGO Star Wars Set, Harry Potter Puzzle, Hot Wheels Car Set, Fisher-Price Learning Toy, JBL Headphones, PlayStation 5 Game, Chess Set, Samsung Galaxy Case, and DC Comics Graphic Novel.
- In 2019 and 2021, the average unit price increased slightly, and so did the quantity. 

  In 2020 and 2022, the average unit price decreased slightly, and so did the quantity. 

  That seemed contrary to the traditional law of demand in economics. However, the main reason might be price adjustments adapting to external factors, such as the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic.
- By Xmas Budget: 
  The medium-budget group: Had the highest purchasing power (49,230 units sold).

  The high-budget group still bought a considerable amount (48,869 units—nearly as much as medium-budget customers), responded positively to price increases, and suggested they were less price-sensitive.

  The low-budget group bought less (48,214 units), likely due to stricter spending limits.
